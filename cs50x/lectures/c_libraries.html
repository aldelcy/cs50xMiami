<h2 class="bold">Libraries</h2>
Libraries in any language are files or ONE compiled file that holds many functions that you can use in your program without having to write those functions yourself.<br>
<br>
<h3 class="bold">Why is that useful?</h3><br>
Somethings will ALWAYS be the same, and never really change, like math properties, or how to find the length of a string. So instead of having to write all that logic yourself, you can use a library where another programmer already wrote those for you.<br>
<br>
<h3 class="bold">Why create personal libraries ( helpers )</h3><br>
Just like external libraries, you may have a function that can be used multiple times in a project. when that happens, you may want to put that function in a library and include it at the top of your file whenever you need in it in that file.<br>
<br>
Think of them as helpers of functions or code you can group together and use without having your code bloated with too many functions.<br>
<br>
You can create your own library of math equations that you will use later.<br>
Or a library of specific password scrambler and key generatorâ€¦ ect.<br>
