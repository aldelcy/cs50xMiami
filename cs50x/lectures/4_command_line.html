<p>
The terminal (or command prompt) is a very powerful tool.<br>
It allows you to navigate folders, create files and directories, delete, rename, move, copy and find files without ever having to touch the mouse. <br>

It allows you to do things fast, efficiently and in bulk.<br>
Things that would take you some time to do by clicking around a user interface.
