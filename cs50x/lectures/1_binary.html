<h2>The Computer</h2>
<p>
  This macgical tool we use everyday is full of surprises.<br>
  Over the course of CS50, you will be using a LOT of it as well as opening under the hood to better understand how it works.
</p>

<p>
  For Now though, let's download the apps and tools we need to do our programming work effectively.
</p>

<h3>Why learn BINARY?</h3>
<p>
  The main reason for learning binary is to understand how computers think at the bottom most level. <br>
  A key aspect involves the comprehension that no real programmer, nor hardware engineer for that matter, deals directly with binary.
</p>

<h3>Why do computers use binary?</h3>

<p>Binary is still the primary language for computers for the following reasons.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is a simple and elegant design.</li>
  <li>Binary's 0 and 1 method is quick to detect an electrical signal's off or on state.</li>
  <li>The positive and negative poles of magnetic media are quickly translated into binary.</li>
  <li>Binary is the most efficient way to control logic circuits.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Will I use binary?</h3>
<p>Most likely not if you are just going to be programming, but it's always fun to know how to read it and why it's used.</p>

      <h2 class="bold">The Imitation Game</h2>
      In 1939, newly created British intelligence agency MI6 recruits Cambridge
      mathematics alumnus Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) to crack Nazi codes,
      including Enigma -- which cryptanalysts had thought unbreakable. Turing's team,
      including Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), analyze Enigma messages while he builds
      a machine to decipher them. Turing and team finally succeed and become heroes.
