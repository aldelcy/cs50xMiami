                        Pseudo code is a term which is often used in programming and algorithm based fields. <br>
                        It is a methodology that allows the programmer to represent the implementation of an algorithm.<br>
                        Simply, we can say that itâ€™s the cooked up representation of an algorithm. Often at times, algorithms are
                        represented with the help of pseudo codes as they can be interpreted by programmers no matter what
                        their programming background or knowledge is. <br>
                        Pseudo code, as the name suggests, is a false code or a representation of code which can be understood
                        by even a layman with some school level programming knowledge.
