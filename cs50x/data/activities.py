					<code>Colder:  Based on the number to guess, you are getting further away compared to the LAST number you guessed.</code><br><br>
					Think of the number you are trying to guess as a center point.<br>
					For example, if the number to guess is <code>10</code> and the last number I guessed was <code>6</code> and now I guess <code>1</code>, then I'm getting colder.<br>
					But if I guess <code>8</code> then I'm getting warmer because <code>8</code> is between <code>6</code> and <code>10</code>.

			Pseudo code is a term which is often used in programming and algorithm based fields. <br>
			It is a methodology that allows the programmer to represent the implementation of an algorithm.<br>
			Simply, we can say that it‚Äôs the cooked up representation of an algorithm. Often at times, algorithms are
			represented with the help of pseudo codes as they can be interpreted by programmers no matter what
			their programming background or knowledge is. <br>
			Pseudo code, as the name suggests, is a false code or a representation of code which can be understood
			by even a layman with some school level programming knowledge.

				<h3>Let's create some files and mess with them</h3>
				<p>In this excercise you will be creating a file structure and manupulate some files in there.</p>
				<h4 class="bold">First, lets create folder ( directory ) called <code>myFirstApp</code></h4>
				<p>In <code>myFirstApp</code>, let's create the following file structure.</p>
				<pre>Hint: You are able to create multiple files or folders with one 'mkdir' command.</pre>
				<p>PS: You are not allowed to use the UI until specifically asked to do so... I will be able to tell.</p>
				<h3 class="bold">File Structure</h3>

				<hr>
				<h3 class="bold">Let the fun begin</h3>
				<br>
				<h4 class="bold">Creating files:</h4>
				<p>
					Navigate to the <code>assets</code> folder and create 3 <code>directories</code>:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>images</li>
						<li>styles</li>
						<li>javascript</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h4 class="bold">Moving files:</h4>
				<p>
					Move all the files with the extension <code>.css</code> into the <code>styles</code> folder. <br>
					Move all the files with the extension <code>.js</code> into the <code>javascript</code> folder. <br>
					<pre>Hint: You can move all the files with the same extension by using the (*) wildcard.</pre>
					<pre>example: You can move all items with a '.png' extension by using '*.png'</pre>
				</p>

				<h4 class="bold">Renaming files:</h4>
				<p>
					In your <code>templates</code> folder, let's rename the following files.<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Rename <code>index.html</code> to <code>home.html</code></li>
						<li>Rename <code>gallery.html</code> to <code>media.html</code></li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h4 class="bold">Creating more files:</h4>
				<p>
					In the <code>root</code> folder off your app, create a folder called <code>temp</code>.<br>
					Using the UI and your browser, find 4 images of cats and drag them to the <code>/temp</code> folder. <br>
				</p>

				<h4 class="bold">Moving more files:</h4>
				<p>
					While STILL in the <code>/temp</code> folder... (do not change directory).
					Move the <code>notes.txt</code> file in <code>/temp</code> folder.<br>
					Display a list of the contents of the <code>/temp</code> folder. <br>
					Move the all the images into the <code>/assets/images</code> folder.<br>
				</p>

				<h4 class="bold">Displaying and Writing:</h4>
				Almost Done.
				<p>
					While STILL in the <code>/temp</code> folder... (do not change directory). <br>
					Display a list of the contents of the <code>/templates</code> folder. <br>
					<h5 class="bold">Bonus:</h5>
					Find out how to <code>add lines of code in a text file</code> from the terminal. <br>
					Copy the name of EACH file in the <code>/templates</code> folder, and add it as a new line in the <code>notes.txt</code> file.
					<pre>If I open the notes.txt file, I should the names of each file in the /templates on a new line.</pre>
				</p>

				<h4 class="bold">SHOW ME then Delete:</h4>
				Now... come show me so that I can make sure you did everything. <br>
				Then you can delete your <code>/temp</code> folder.
