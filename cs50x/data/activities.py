                        Pseudo code is a term which is often used in programming and algorithm based fields. <br>
                        It is a methodology that allows the programmer to represent the implementation of an algorithm.<br>
                        Simply, we can say that itâ€™s the cooked up representation of an algorithm. Often at times, algorithms are
                        represented with the help of pseudo codes as they can be interpreted by programmers no matter what
                        their programming background or knowledge is. <br>
                        Pseudo code, as the name suggests, is a false code or a representation of code which can be understood
                        by even a layman with some school level programming knowledge.

                    <p>
                        Write a simple program in C that asks the user to guess a number. <br>
                        Think about how you will store the number they need to guess <br>
                        After they entered the number it, if they guessed it, print "HOORRAY!" <br>
                        If they did not guess it, print "Try Again". <br> <br>
                        You do not need to include a loop in this. once they guess it and you printed the result. we can run the program again. <br>
                    </p> <br>

                    <h3 class="bold">Simple Convo</h3>
                    <p>

                        First, ask their name. <br>
                        Then print a response to the user's name like. "Hi there Bob." <br>
                        Then ask another follow-up question and answer that question in your program. <br>
                        You can ask up to 3 to 5 questions. <br> <br>

                    <p>
                        Write a simple program that asks the user to enter 2 numbers.<br>
                        After the user enters the 2 numbers. in your program perform a mathematical calculation and print the result.<br>

                        As a bobus to this task, You can give the user some options as to what mathematical operation they woulr like to perform. <br> <br>

                        <code>hint: tell them when they can write</code> <br>
                        An based on what they chose, use an if else to choose what operation to run.
