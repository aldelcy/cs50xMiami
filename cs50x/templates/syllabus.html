                            During our lectures students are encouraged to participate in live demonstrations of problems.
                            Often this involves, students playing the role of a computer, mimicking the memory in a computer,
                            or just acting out instructions. The word &quot;lecture&quot; is used pretty loosely in CS50x Miami.

                            <li>Style: To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and intended with variables aptly named? Can I easily tell (via braces/indentation) the boundaries of each block of code?Is it clear what this variable does, based on its name? If I didn&rsquo;t understand C code, would I be able to tell what is happening based on comments alone? Are there so few or so many comments that I am distracted by their presence or absence?</li>
                            <li>Design: To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)? Can Repeated code be eliminated?

                        <p>Lectures are supplemented by weekly, 120-minute sections led by the teaching fellows. Sections provide you with opportunities to explore the course&#39;s material in a more intimate environment, with only your teaching fellow and a handful of classmates present, as well as to dive into hands-on activities. Although you can attend multiple sections if your personal schedule allows, you are required to attend the same section you signed up for during selection at minimum.</p>

                        <p>Most sections, students will be assigned a programming activity to complete and will be randomly divided into groups of 2. This activity will be related to the material that they learned in the lectures for that week. While these activities are not graded, students gain additional insight into the assigned P-sets. </p>

                        <h5>Each Section will contain...</h5>

                        <ul class="card-text">

                        <p>Section material will correspond with the proceeding lecture material and will will coincide with the schedule above for Harvard Lecture material weeks 0-9b (approximately 15 section meetings).</p>

                        <p>Coding hours are opportunities for assistance with problem sets alongside the course&#39;s teaching staff. Office hours schedule sometimes overlap with sections, but their help is always available as there will be multiple staff members on hand.

                <hr class="uk-divider-small">

                <p>The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon this courses lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you, albeit subject to the staff&#39;s approval. All that we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, that you impact campus, or that you change the world. Strive to create something that outlives this course.</p>

                <p>That being said, there are some provisos. You may implement your project in any language(s) as long as the staff approves. You are welcome to utilize any infrastructure, provided the staff ultimately has access to any hardware and software that your project requires. The Idea Center has some hardware that may be used in some cases.</p>

                <p>Inasmuch as software development is rarely a one-person effort, you are allowed an opportunity to collaborate with one or two classmates for this final project. Needless to say, it is expected that every student in any such group contribute equally to the design and implementation of that group&rsquo;s project. Moreover, it is expected that the scope of a two- or three-person group&rsquo;s project be, respectively, twice or thrice that of a typical one-person project. A one-person project, mind you, should entail more time and effort than is required by each of the course&rsquo;s problem sets. Although no more than three students may design and implement a given project, you are welcome to solicit advice from others, so long as you respect the course&rsquo;s policy on academic honesty.</p>

                <p>The final project consists of 3 parts:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A project proposal. Students must present their projects in a closed-room presentation to the teaching staff. This presentation should be no more than 5 minutes in length and should describe what the individual or team wishes to accomplish in the final project. All projects must be pitched in this manner and approved before the project submission will be accepted for grading.</li>
                    <li>A project blog page. Each individual student (regardless if they are on a team) must create a blogging Website. This site must not utilize an existing content management system. A user authentication system should be implemented which allows a registered user to create, edit, or delete blog posts.</li>
                    <li>An individual or collaborative final project as described above. This project may utilize any content you learned from the core CS50x Miami material or the extended tracks near the end of the course.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Each component of the project will be graded and the respected weighted totals will be applied to the student&#39;s final grade.</p>
